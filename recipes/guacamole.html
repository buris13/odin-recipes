        <p>There are few things as easy, healthy, and delicious as this ubiquitous dip. However, unless you're grinding your aromatic vegetation in a molcajete, or against a cutting board, you're really not tasting a classic guacamole.</p>
        <p>The flavors not only become more intense, but actually change in character. This is just what those bland, fatty, but delectable avocados need. That and a thoughtful seasoning of lime juice, and maybe some more salt.</p>

        <h2 class="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="ul guacamole">
            <li>2 tablespoons minced fresh serrano chili</li>
            <li>½ cup chopped fresh cilantro, divided</li>
            <li>¼ cup finely diced white onion</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt for grinding vegetables, plus more to taste</li>
            <li>4 large Hass avocados</li>
            <li>1 cup diced ripe tomatoes, drained (Optional)</li>
            <li>1 lime, juiced, or more to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place minced peppers, 1/4 cup of the chopped cilantro, and the diced onions on a cutting board. Chop them together into very small pieces. Sprinkle with kosher salt. Using the flat side of the knife blade, smear the mixture to work it into a paste, and chop again to achieve as fine a texture as possible.</li>
            <li>Stem, halve, and pit the avocados. Scoop out flesh and place in a bowl. Add 1/4 cup chopped cilantro, onion and serrano mixture, salt, and fresh lime juice. Mash with a potato masher to desired texture (smooth or chunky), 5 or 6 minutes. Taste and adjust seasonings. If not serving immediately, cover and refrigerate.</li>
        </ol>
