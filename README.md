# odin-recipes
Hello everyone, this repo is my practice from The Odin Project
and now i'm just finished it. In this practice i got the assignments 
that make a recipes website, using html and git. Sometime i got trouble or forget something but i love doing this.
Yeah, i think only that content on this, sorry for my bad english.

THANKS FOR README!!!
